# PE_Malware_Detection
The target of this project is to analyze how malignant Program Executable (PE) files can be detected on any device by using Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning algorithms. The efficiency and viability of the detection relies on the quantity of highlights and the learning calculations. In this project, we analyzed a modest 12 important features, out of the 54 available features of any PE file. These features were extracted from metadata, packing, imported DLLs and elements of four unique sorts of PE files for malware recognition. The returned results showed that the proposed framework can accomplish 99.48% recognition rates, 0.45% false positive rate and a 0.90% false negative rate.
